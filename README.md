# LLM Tests

This repository is dedicated to testing the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with a focus on small games and interactive prototypes.

The first test in this series is a two-player game called **Viper Clone**, implemented in HTML and JavaScript.

The detailed game specification is included in the repository (`viper/spec.md`).
