# LLM Tests

This repository is dedicated to testing the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with a focus on small games and interactive prototypes.

## Viper Clone

The first test in this series is a two-player game called **Viper Clone**, implemented in HTML and JavaScript.
Among all models, **GPT o1-pro** performed best in collision detection â€” though it incorrectly positioned the players.

The detailed game specification is included in the repository (`viper/spec.md`).
